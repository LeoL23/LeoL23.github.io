    <h1>Change Log</h1>

    <h2>Page 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Line 22 was missing /li at the end of Item 3 to close out. </li>
            <li>Line 28 was missing a /p to close out p </li>
            <li>Line 34 was missing a /td to close out the line of code.
            <li>Line 40 was missing /tr to close out tr
            <li>Line 43 needed a closing table tag as table was called on line 32.
        </ul>

    <h2>Page 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Line 25 was: "The b New Beehive Inn ". There was supposed to be a /b after Inn instead, so I changed it to that. </li>
            <li>Line 61: there was an unnecessaery ; after a /a, so I got rid of the ; </li>
            <li>Fixed ordering of headers. H6 became an h3, swapped an h3 and h2 to make the subheadings make sense/accurate</li>
            <li>Added the missing stylesheet link</li>
            <li>Apostrophes were highlighed in the closure paragraph, fixed</li>
            <li>The "link," 'where do i go' causes an error link because it has spaces/incomplete link. I found the real link from the Source Page & replaced it.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Had to add missing title, meta, and link to css stylesheet</li>
