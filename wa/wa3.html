        <h2></h2>
            <p>AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973. It was founded by rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Young">Malcolm Young</a> and lead guitarist Angus Young. The band's current lineup comprises with founding member and songwriter Angus, rhythm guitarist Stevie Young, bassist Cliff Williams, drummer Phil Rudd, and long-time lead vocalist Brian Johnson. Their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, but the band calls it simply "rock and roll". They are cited as a former influence on the new wave of British heavy metal bands, such as Iron Maiden and Saxon. AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.
                AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their debut album, High Voltage (1975). Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers with Bon Scott (lead vocals), Mark Evans (bass) and Phil Rudd (drums). Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has since appeared on every album since Powerage (1978). Seven months after the release of the band's breakthrough album Highway to Hell (1979), Scott died of alcohol poisoning and the other members considered disbanding. However, at the request of Scott's parents, they continued together and recruited English singer Brian Johnson as their new frontman. Their first album with Johnson, Back in Black (1980), was dedicated to Scott's memory. It was a widespread success, launching the band to new heights and becoming the second-best-selling album of all time.  
                The band's eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock (1981), was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Prior to the release of their next album, Flick of the Switch (1983), Rudd left the band and was replaced by Simon Wright, who was himself replaced by Chris Slade six years later. The band experienced a commercial resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of their twelfth studio album The Razors Edge (1990); it was their only album to feature Slade, who was replaced by the returning Rudd in 1994. Rudd has since recorded five more albums with the band, starting with Ballbreaker (1995). Their fifteenth studio album Black Ice was the second-highest-selling album of 2008 and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching number 1 worldwide.
                The band's lineup remained the same for 20 years until 2014, when Malcolm Young retired due to early-onset dementia (from which he died three years later) and Rudd became involved in legal troubles. Malcolm was replaced by his nephew Stevie Young, who debuted on the album Rock or Bust (2014). On the accompanying tour, previous drummer Chris Slade filled in for Rudd. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to worsening hearing loss, and Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose stepped in as the band's frontman for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-time bassist and backing vocalist Williams retired at the end of the Rock or Bust World Tour in 2016, and the group entered a four-year hiatus. A reunion of the Rock or Bust line-up was announced in September 2020, and the band's seventeenth studio album Power Up was released two months later. In September 2023, it was revealed that American drummer Matt Laug will be filling in for the upcoming Power Trip festival.</p>

            <h3>Formation and name (1973–1974)</h3>
                <p>In November 1973, Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC with bassist and saxophonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Van_Kriedt">Larry Van Kriedt</a>, vocalist Dave Evans, and drummer Colin Burgess.[1] The band's first official gig was at Chequers nightclub in Sydney on 31 December 1973.[2] By this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang.[3] In its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit. On stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet. In Paul Stenning's book AC/DC: Two Sides To Every Glory it was stated that Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's bitter feeling toward Evans.
                    Malcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials "AC/DC" on the AC adapter of a sewing machine. "AC/DC" is an abbreviation meaning "alternating current/direct current" electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, power-driven performances of their music.[5] "AC/DC" is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as "Acca Dacca" in Australia.[6] The AC/DC band name is stylised with a high voltage sign separating the "AC" and "DC" and has been used on all studio albums, with the exception of the international version of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.[7] 
                    In January 1974, the band recorded a session at EMI Studios in Sydney, with producers George Young and Harry Vanda. A number of songs were recorded, including "Can I Sit Next To You, Girl" and "Rockin' In The Parlour", and an early version of "Rock 'n' Roll Singer".[8] A week after this session Burgess was fired, followed shortly thereafter by Van Kriedt, his recorded bass lines for the January recording session replaced by ones played by George Young. Their replacements, Neil Smith on bass and Noel Taylor on drums, lasted six weeks, replaced in turn by Rob Bailey on bass and Peter Clack on drums. "Can I Sit Next To You, Girl" backed with "Rockin' In The Parlour", taken from the January session, would be released on 22 July 1974 as the band's first single.[8][9]
                    By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation, which led to a support slot for the visiting Lou Reed in August. During that tour, Malcolm switched to rhythm guitar, leaving Angus the lead, the roles the two guitarists would play from then on.[10] Sometime in 1974, on the recommendation of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club, the Hard Rock. He was not pleased with their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and Harry Vanda.[11] The Young brothers decided to abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end, they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group.[4] Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.</p>
            <h3>Bon Scott joins, and beginnings (1974–1976)</h3>
                <p>In September 1974, Bon Scott, an experienced vocalist from Fraternity after friend Vince Lovegrove recommended him to George Young. Scott's appointment coincided with him working as a chauffeur for the band at the time until an audition promoted him to lead singer.[12] Like the Young brothers, Scott was born in Scotland and emigrated to Australia in his childhood. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, "Can I Sit Next to You, Girl" / "Rockin' in the Parlour"; the song was re-written and re-recorded with Bon Scott.
                    By October 1974, AC/DC had recorded their first studio album, High Voltage. While Bailey and Clack were still in the band during its recording, Bailey played only on one track, the rest being played by session drummer Tony Currenti, while George Young handled some of the bass parts and later redid others. Recording the album took only ten days and was based on instrumentals written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott.[13] The period December 1974 to March 1975 saw rapid turnover within the band: both Bailey and Clack were fired, with Paul Matters taking over bass duties briefly before being fired in turn and replaced temporarily by George or Malcolm Young for live duties, while on drums, Ron Carpenter and Russell Coleman also had brief tenures before Phil Rudd joined the band in January. Bassist Mark Evans joined in March 1975, setting the lineup that would survive for the next two years.[14]
                    The band were scheduled to play at the 1975 Sunbury Pop music festival in January; however, they went home without performing following an altercation with the management and crew of headlining act Deep Purple.[15] High Voltage was released exclusively in Australia on 17 February 1975,[16] along with a single "Baby, Please Don't Go" / "Love Song". Later that year they released the single "It's a Long Way to the Top", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program Countdown, featuring the band miming the song on the back of a flatbed truck. AC/DC released their second studio album, T.N.T., on 1 December 1975, which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand.[17]
                </p>
            <h3>Initial success, and record deal (1976–1977)</h3>
                <p>Browning sent promo material to contacts in London, which came to the attention of Phil Carson of Atlantic Records. In 1976, the band signed an international deal with Atlantic Records. On arrival in London, their scheduled tour with Back Street Crawler was cancelled following the death of Paul Kossoff. As a result, they went back to playing smaller venues to build a local following until their label organised the "Lock Up Your Daughters" tour sponsored by Sounds magazine, the only major music magazine which was still relatively receptive to traditional rock music. At the time, punk rock was breaking and came to dominate the pages of the major British music weeklies, NME and Melody Maker. AC/DC were sometimes identified with the punk rock movement by the British press, but the band hated punk rock, believing it to be a passing fad—manager Michael Browning wrote that "it wasn't possible to even hold a conversation with AC/DC about punk without them getting totally pissed off".[11] Their reputation managed to survive the punk upheavals and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time.[18] Angus Young gained notoriety for mooning the audience during live performances.
                    The first AC/DC album to gain worldwide distribution was a 1976 compilation of tracks taken from the High Voltage and T.N.T. LPs. Also titled High Voltage, and released on the Atlantic Records label, the album has to date sold three million copies worldwide.[19][20] The track selection was heavily weighted toward the more recent T.N.T., including only two songs from their first LP. The band's third studio album, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, was released in the same year in both Australian and international versions, like its predecessor. Track listings varied worldwide, and the international version of the album also featured the T.N.T. track "Rocker", which had previously not been released internationally. The original Australian version included "Jailbreak" (now more readily available on the 1984 compilation EP '74 Jailbreak or as a live version on the 1992 Live album). Dirty Deeds was not released in the US until 1981, by which time the band were at the peak of their popularity.
                    After a brief tour of Sweden, they returned to London where they set new attendance records during their residency at the Marquee. However, their appearance at the 1976 Reading Festival failed to get a response from the crowd. They toured extensively throughout Europe, then returned to tour Australia in late 1976 to rebuild their finances and record their fourth studio album, Let There Be Rock.
                    In early 1977, they returned to Britain and began a European tour with Black Sabbath. While Bon Scott and Ozzy Osbourne quickly became friends, relations were less than cordial between the other members of the respective bands. In one incident, Geezer Butler pulled a "knife" on Malcolm Young, though it was a "silly" flick-knife comb.[21][22] Later in the year they toured with Rainbow.</p>
            <h3>Cliff Williams joins, and death of Bon Scott (1977–1980)</h3>
                <p>In mid-1977, bassist Mark Evans was dismissed. Evans described disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor. He was replaced by Cliff Williams, an experienced bass player who had played with several UK bands since the late 60s.[12] Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, "You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much of a nice guy."[3] Mark Evans' autobiography, Dirty Deeds: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.
                    AC/DC's first American radio exposure was through Bill Bartlett at Jacksonville station WPDQ/WAIV in 1975,[24] two years before they played their first US concert as support band for Canadian group Moxy in Austin, Texas, on 27 July 1977.[25] Under the guidance of booking agent Doug Thaler of American Talent International and later the management of Leber-Krebs, they gained invaluable experience of the US stadium circuit, supporting leading rock acts such as Ted Nugent, Aerosmith, Kiss, Styx, UFO, and Blue Öyster Cult, and co-headlined with bands such as Cheap Trick.
                    AC/DC released their fifth studio album, Powerage, on 5 May 1978, and with its harder riffs, followed the blueprint set by Let There Be Rock.[26] Only one single was released from Powerage, "Rock 'n' Roll Damnation/Sin City". An appearance at the Apollo Theatre, Glasgow during the Powerage tour was recorded and released as If You Want Blood You've Got It.
                    The major breakthrough in the band's career came in their collaboration with producer "Mutt" Lange on the band's sixth studio album Highway to Hell, released in 1979. Eddie Van Halen notes this to be his favourite AC/DC record, along with Powerage.[27] It became the first AC/DC LP to break into the Billboard 200, eventually reaching number 17,[28] and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts.[18] Highway to Hell had lyrics that shifted away from flippant and comical toward more central rock themes, putting increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats.[29]
                    In February 1980, the band began to work on their seventh studio album Back in Black, with Scott on drums.[30] On 18 February, Scott purportedly passed out in the car on the way back to the apartment of an acquaintance called Alistair Kinnear, after a night of drinking and alleged drug-taking at The Music Machine in Camden Town, London.[31][30] According to Kinnear, upon arrival at his home, he was unable to move Scott from the car into his home for the night, so he left him in the car overnight to sleep off the effects of the alcohol. Unable to wake Scott early on the evening of 19 February, Kinnear rushed him to King's College Hospital in Camberwell, where Scott was pronounced dead on arrival.[30] Pulmonary aspiration of vomit was cited as the cause of Scott's death, but the official cause was listed as "acute alcohol poisoning".[32] Scott's family buried him in Fremantle, Western Australia, the area they emigrated to when he was a boy.[33]

            <h3>Brian Johnson joins, and rebirth (1980–1983)</h3>
                <p>Following Scott's death, the band briefly considered quitting, but encouraged by the insistence from Scott's parents that he would have wanted them to carry on, they decided to continue, and went about finding a new vocalist.[12] Allan Fryer of Fat Lip, ex-Rick Wakeman vocalist Gary Pickford-Hopkins,[34] and the Easybeats' singer Stevie Wright were touted by the press as possible replacements.[35] Various other candidates were also considered, including ex-Moxy member Buzz Shearman, who was not able to join because of voice issues,[36] Slade vocalist Noddy Holder,[37] and ex-Back Street Crawler vocalist Terry Slesser.[38]
                        At the advice of Lange, the group brought in ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson, who impressed the group.[39] For the audition, Johnson sang Ike & Tina Turner's "Nutbush City Limits" and then "Whole Lotta Rosie" from Let There Be Rock.[40] After the band begrudgingly worked through the rest of the list of applicants in the following days, Johnson returned for a second rehearsal.[41]
                        Angus Young later recalled, "I remember the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him."[42]
                </p>
            <h3>Lineup changes, and commercial decline (1983–1990)</h3>
                <p>The band parted ways with producer Mutt Lange for their ninth studio album, Flick of the Switch, released on 15 August 1983.[48] The album was an effort to return to the rawness and simplicity of their early albums, but received mixed reviews and was considered underdeveloped and unmemorable;[49][50] one critic stated that the band "had made the same album nine times".[51] AC/DC were voted the eighth-biggest disappointment of the year in the 1984 Kerrang! readers' poll. However, Flick of the Switch eventually reached number 4 on the UK charts,[45] and AC/DC had minor success with the singles "Nervous Shakedown" and "Flick of the Switch".
                        After having problems with drugs and alcohol,[52] drummer Phil Rudd's friendship with Malcolm Young deteriorated and eventually escalated to a physical confrontation after which Rudd was fired halfway through the Flick of the Switch sessions.[53] Former Procol Harum drummer B.J. Wilson was drafted in to help complete the recordings, but his drum parts were eventually not used, as Rudd had already completed the drum parts.[54] Rudd was replaced by Simon Wright in the summer of 1983 after the band held over 700 auditions in the US and UK.[55] Simon Kirke of Free and Bad Company fame, and Paul Thompson of Roxy Music were two of the drummers auditioned.[56]
                        The band's tenth studio album, Fly on the Wall, produced by the Young brothers in 1985, was also regarded as uninspired and directionless.[57] A music concept video of the same name featured the band at a bar, playing five of the album's ten songs.[58]
                </p>
            <h3>Popularity regained (1990–1999)</h3>
                <p>The band's twelfth studio album, The Razors Edge, was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser and produced by Bruce Fairbairn, who had previously worked with Aerosmith and Bon Jovi. Released in 1990, it was a major success for the band, and included the hits "Thunderstruck" and "Are You Ready", which reached number 5 and number 16 respectively on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart,[65] and "Moneytalks", which peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.[66] The album went multi-platinum and reached the US top ten. In September 1991, 1.6 million people attended the Monsters of Rock festival in Moscow to enjoy the first open-air rock concert to be held in the former Soviet Union. The show, also featuring Pantera, The Black Crowes and Metallica, had one of the largest attendances ever for a musical event.[67]
                        Several shows on the Razors Edge World Tour were recorded for the 1992 live album, titled Live. Live was produced by Fairbairn, and has been called one of the best live albums of the 1990s.[68] AC/DC headlined the Monsters of Rock show during this tour, which was released on DVD as Live at Donington. During the tour, three fans were killed at a concert at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City, Utah on 18 January 1991: when the concert began fans rushed the stage crushing the three and injuring others.[69] It took 20 minutes before venue security and the group understood the severity of the situation and halted the concert. AC/DC settled with the victims' families out of court. As a result of this incident, the Salt Palace eliminated festival seating from future events.[70][71]
                        In 1993, AC/DC recorded "Big Gun" for the soundtrack of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Last Action Hero. Released as a single, the song reached number 1 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart—the band's first number 1 single on that chart.[65] In 1994, Pacific Gameworks created a proposal for a beat 'em up video game project intended for the Atari Jaguar CD titled AC/DC: Defenders of Metal, which would have prominently featured the AC/DC crew, however, production of the game never started and it was left unreleased.[72]
                </p>
            <h3>Popularity confirmed (1999–2014)</h3>
                <p>In 1999, AC/DC recorded their fourteenth studio album, Stiff Upper Lip, produced by brother George Young at the Warehouse Studio, again in Vancouver. Released in February 2000, the album was better received by critics than Ballbreaker but was considered lacking in new ideas.[77][78] The Australian release included a bonus disc with three promotional videos and several live performances recorded in Madrid, Spain in 1996. The first single, "Stiff Upper Lip", remained at number 1 on the US Mainstream Rock charts for four weeks.[65] The band also performed that song live when they appeared as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on March 18, 2000.[79] The other singles released also charted – "Satellite Blues" and "Safe in New York City" reached number 7 and number 31 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks.[65]
                        In 2002, AC/DC signed a long-term, multi-album deal with Sony Music,[80][81] who went on to release a series of remastered albums as part of their AC/DC remasters series. Each release contained an expanded booklet featuring rare photographs, memorabilia, and notes.[82] In 2003, the entire back-catalogue (except Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip) was remastered and re-released.[83][84] Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip was later re-released in 2004.[85] Also in 2003, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[86]
                        On 30 July 2003, the band performed with the Rolling Stones and Rush at Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto. The concert, held before an audience of half a million, was intended to help the city overcome the negative publicity stemming from the effects of a 2003 SARS epidemic. The concert holds the record for the largest paid music event in North American history.[87] The band came second in a list of Australia's highest-earning entertainers for 2005,[88] and sixth for 2006,[89] despite having neither toured since 2003 nor released an album since 2000. Verizon Wireless has gained the rights to release AC/DC's full albums and the entire Live at Donington concert to download in 2008.[90]
                        On 16 October 2007, Columbia Records released a double and triple DVD titled Plug Me In. The set consists of five and seven hours of rare footage, and even a recording of AC/DC at a high school performing "School Days", "T.N.T.", "She's Got Balls", and "It's a Long Way to the Top". As with Family Jewels, disc one contains rare shows of the band with Bon Scott, and disc two is about the Brian Johnson era. The collector's edition contains an extra DVD with 21 more rare performances of both Scott and Johnson and more interviews.[91]

            <h3>Multiple lineup changes, and hiatus (2014–2018)</h3>
                <p>On 16 April 2014, in response to earlier reports that the band may be disbanding due to Malcolm Young's illness,[114] Brian Johnson commented that AC/DC were not completely disbanding, stating "We are definitely getting together in May in Vancouver. We're going to pick up guitars, have a plonk and see if anybody has got any tunes or ideas. If anything happens we'll record it." In July 2014, AC/DC announced that they had finished recording their next album and that Malcolm's nephew, Stevie Young, replaced Malcolm in the studio.[115] On 23 September 2014, AC/DC confirmed that Malcolm had officially departed from the band.[116] Malcolm's last show with the band was on 28 June 2010 in Bilbao, Spain;[117] he died on 18 November 2017 at the age of 64.[118]
                        Drummer Phil Rudd released his first solo album, Head Job, on 29 August 2014.[119] He confirmed that there would be another AC/DC tour, and stated that the band had no intention of retiring.[120] On 23 September 2014, The band revealed that the band's sixteenth studio album, Rock or Bust, featuring eleven new tracks, would be released on 28 November 2014 as the first AC/DC album in the band's history without Malcolm Young on the recordings.[116] The band also announced plans for a world tour to promote the new album with Malcolm and Angus' nephew Stevie Young as Malcolm's replacement.[121]
                        On 6 November 2014, Rudd was charged with attempting to procure a murder, threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of cannabis, following a police raid on his home.[122][123] The charge of attempting to procure a murder was withdrawn the following day, but the other charges remained.[124] AC/DC released a statement clarifying that the tour promoting Rock or Bust would continue, but did not say whether or not Rudd would participate, or if he was still a member of the band.[125]
                        At the charity signing before the Grammy Awards, the band was photographed together with former drummer Chris Slade. It was later confirmed that he had rejoined the band for the Grammys and upcoming tour.[126] In April 2015, Rudd pleaded guilty to drug charges and threatening to kill a former assistant.[127] Shortly thereafter, the band's web site removed Rudd as the band's drummer and replaced him with Slade.[128] On 9 July 2015, Rudd was denied a discharge without conviction and sentenced to eight months of home detention.[129]
                </p>
            <h3>Reunion and Power Up (2018–present)</h3>
                <p>On 28 September 2020, the band updated their social media accounts with a short video clip depicting an illumination of a neon light in the shape of the band's lightning bolt logo. This led to speculation that they were "preparing to announce its comeback, possibly as early as this week or next week."[140] On the next day, the band's official website was redirected to pwrup.acdc.com, and updated with an AC/DC online store and a "Power Up" e-mail sign-up, leading to speculation that Power Up would be the title of the new album. This speculation was also fuelled by another teaser video from AC/DC, simply featuring the hashtag #PWRUP.[141] On 30 September, AC/DC officially confirmed the return of Brian Johnson, Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams to the band, alongside Angus and Stevie Young, reuniting the Rock or Bust recording line-up.[142]
                        On 1 October 2020, AC/DC released a snippet of their new song "Shot in the Dark".[143] Shortly thereafter, the band's official website published a few photographs of several different posters displayed in different cities (from different countries) – such as Ashfield (in front of Angus Young's Ashfield Boys High School), Lille, London and Dallas – featuring the writing "PWR/UP".[144] On 7 October, the band confirmed the upcoming release on 13 November 2020 of their new studio album, Power Up, and released the first single taken from it, "Shot in the Dark".[145] The album's track listing was revealed on their website, via a spinning promotional album.[146] Angus Young also noted that the new album, as was Rock or Bust, is dedicated to Malcolm Young, much in the same way that Back in Black was dedicated to Bon Scott.[147]
                        On 31 March 2023, AC/DC revealed that they are set to officially co-headline Power Trip festival, at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, on 7 October.[148] On 9 September, AC/DC has revealed that Williams will be performing for the festival, after coming out of retirement.[149] They also revealed that American drummer Matt Laug, who also played for many bands/artists such as Slash's Snakepit and Alice Cooper, will also be part of the lineup, while posting rehearsal audio of them playing "If You Want Blood (You've Got It)" to their social media accounts.[150]

        <h2>Musical style</h2>
            <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_(website)">Vulture</a> music journalist David Marchese, the instrumental foundation of the band's simple sound was the drummer—Rudd, Wright, or Slade—striking the kick drum on the first and third beat of every measure, and the snare drum on the second and fourth beat; bassist Williams consistently downpicking an eighth note; Angus Young performing lead parts that possessed "a clear architecture and even sort of swing, in a frenzied, half-demented way"; and Malcolm Young's "propulsive" yet nuanced rhythm guitar featuring "little chuks, stutters, and silences that give the monstrous riffs life".[151] For the majority of Malcolm Young's tenure in AC/DC, he used a Marshall Super Bass head to amplify his rhythm guitar while recording in the studio. According to Chris Gill of Guitar World, the amplifier helped define his signature guitar tone: "clean but as loud as possible to ride on the razor's edge of power amp distortion and deliver the ideal combination of grind, twang, clang and crunch, with no distorted preamp 'hair,' fizz or compression", as heard on songs such as "Let There Be Rock", "Dirty Deeds", "For Those About to Rock", and "Thunderstruck". During 1978 to 1980, however, Young used a Marshall 2203 100-watt master volume head, which Gill speculates may have contributed to a "slightly more distorted and dark" guitar tone on the albums from that period, including Powerage and Back in Black.[152]
                In a comparison of AC/DC's vocalists, Robert Christgau said Bon Scott exhibited a "blokelike croak" and "charm", often singing about sexual aggression in the guise of fun: "Like Ian Hunter or Roger Chapman though without their panache, he has fun being a dirty young man". Johnson, in his opinion, possessed "three times the range and wattage" as a vocalist while projecting the character of a "bloke as fantasy-fiction demigod". By the time Johnson had fully acclimated himself with 1981's For Those About to Rock We Salute You, Christgau said he defined "an anthemic grandiosity more suitable to [the band's] precious-metal status than Bon Scott's old-fashioned raunch", albeit in a less intelligent manner.[153]

            <h3>Influence</h3>
                <p>Several musicians have credited AC/DC for reasserting hard rock's popularity after it had ceded mainstream attention to other musical genres in the late 1970s.[154][155] Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave noted: "Disco was huge and punk and new wave were ascendant, and along came this AC/DC record (Back in Black) which just destroyed everybody. It put hard rock music back on the throne, where it belongs!"[155]
                    AC/DC's music was a formative influence on the new wave of British heavy metal bands that emerged in the late 1970s, such as Saxon and Iron Maiden, in part as a reaction to the decline of traditional early 1970s hard rock bands. In 2007, critics noted that AC/DC, along with Thin Lizzy, UFO, Scorpions, and Judas Priest, were among "the second generation of rising stars ready to step into the breach as the old guard waned."[156] Over the years, many prominent rock musicians have gone on to cite AC/DC as an influence, including Dave Mustaine of Megadeth,[157] Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Kyuss,[158] Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters,[159] Scott Ian of Anthrax,[160] Eric Peterson of Testament,[161] Dexter Holland of The Offspring,[162] Brian Baker of Bad Religion, Minor Threat, Dag Nasty and Junkyard,[163] and bands such as Metallica,[164] Exodus,[165] and The Living End.[166]
                    Gene Simmons of hard rock contemporaries Kiss remarked that, "A lot of people look the same and act the same and do the same thing. Every once in a while you see a band like AC/DC. Nobody's like them. We'd like to think we're unique in that way too."[167] Slash of Guns N' Roses called them "with the exception of the [Rolling] Stones, the greatest rock 'n' roll band ever."[168]
                    "I always liked them," said Australian compatriot and singer-songwriter Nick Cave.[169] "We had this TV show called Countdown and they were often on and they were always a riot and absolutely unique. They were a heavy rock band, but Bon Scott would go on Countdown dressed as a schoolgirl and stuff like that. They were always very anarchic and never took the thing too seriously."

            <h3>Genres</h3>
                <p>With the recording of Back in Black in 1980, rock journalist Joe S. Harrington believed the band had departed further from the blues-oriented rock of their previous albums, and toward a more dynamic attack that adopted punk rock's "high-energy implications" and transmuted their hard rock/heavy metal songs into "more pop-oriented blasts". The band would remain faithful for the remainder of their career, to this "impeccably ham-handed" musical style: "the guitars were compacted into a singular statement of rhythmic efficiency, the rhythm section provided the thunderhorse overdrive, and vocalist Johnson belowed and brayed like the most unhinged practitioner of bluesy top-man dynamics since vintage Robert Plant."[170]
                    AC/DC have referred to themselves as "a rock and roll band, nothing more, nothing less".[18] In the opinion of Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, they are "one of the defining acts of '70s hard rock" and reactionary to the period's art rock and arena rock excesses: "AC/DC's rock was minimalist – no matter how huge and bludgeoning their guitar chords were, there was a clear sense of space and restraint."[171] According to Alexis Petridis, their music is "hard-edged, wilfully basic blues-rock" featuring humorous sexual innuendo and lyrics about rock and roll.[172] Music academic Robert McParland described the band's sound as being defined by the heavy rock guitar of the Young brothers, layered power chords, and forceful vocals.[173] "For some, AC/DC are the ultimate heavy metal act", Tim Jonze wrote in The Guardian, "but for others, AC/DC aren't a heavy metal act at all, they're a classic rock band – and calling them heavy metal is an act of treachery."[174] On the controversy of categorising their music, McParland wrote:
                    AC/DC will assert that they are not specifically a metal band. Their music—loud, hard, and guitar-driven—may best be described as hard rock. However, there are people who will say that they are indisputably metal. Therein lies the ongoing problem of categorisation. While AC/DC has referenced the underworld and they have given their listeners 'Highway to Hell' and 'Hell's Bells,' their songs are constructed on straightforward major and minor power chords. They are not modally developed as are a good deal of heavy metal compositions. Their sound is loud and crisp, not muddy or down-tuned.[173]
                </p>
        <h2>Criticism</h2>
                <p>Throughout the band's career, their songs have been criticised as simplistic, monotonous, deliberately lowbrow, and sexist. David Marchese from Vulture wrote that, "regardless of the lyricist, whether it was Scott (who was capable of real wit and colour), Johnson, or the Young brothers, there's a deep strain of misogyny in the band's output that veers from feeling terribly dated to straight-up reprehensible."[151] According to Christgau in 1988, "the brutal truth is that sexism has never kept a great rock-and-roller down—from Muddy to Lemmy, lots of dynamite music has objectified women in objectionable ways. But rotely is not among those ways", in regards to AC/DC.[153] Fans of the band have defended their music by highlighting its "bawdy humour",[175] while members of the group have generally been dismissive of claims that their songs are sexist, arguing that they are meant to be in jest.[151] In an interview with Sylvie Simmons for Mojo, Angus called the band "pranksters more than anything else", while Malcolm said "we're not like some macho band. We take the music far more seriously than we take the lyrics, which are just throwaway lines."[175] Marchese regarded the musical aspect of the Youngs' songs "strong enough to render the words a functional afterthought", as well as "deceptively plain, devastatingly effective, and extremely lucrative".[151]
                    For the book Under My Thumb: Songs That Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them, The Guardian arts critic Fiona Sturges contributed an essay evaluating her love for AC/DC. While acknowledging she is a feminist, and that the band's music is problematic for her, she believed it would be "daft, as opposed to damaging", for female listeners if they can understand the band to be "a bunch of archly sex-obsessed idiots with sharp tunes and some seriously killer riffs". In spite of the "unpleasant sneering quality" of "Carry Me Home"'s claims about a woman who "ain't no lady", the "rape fantasy" of "Let Me Put My Love into You", and the generally one-dimensional portrayals of women, Sturges said songs such as "Whole Lotta Rosie" and "You Shook Me All Night Long" demonstrated that the female characters "are also having a good time and are, more often than not, in the driving seat in sexual terms... it's the men who come over as passive and hopeless, awestruck in the presence of sexual partners more experienced and adept than them."[175]

        <h2 id="Awards">Awards and achievements</h2>
                <p>On 22 March 2000, the municipality of Leganés (near Madrid) named a street in honour of the band as "Calle de AC/DC" ("AC/DC Street").[181] Malcolm and Angus attended the inauguration with many fans.[181] Later that day, the plaque with the name of the group was stolen, perhaps by an enthusiast or collector. The plaque was replaced two hours later, and stolen once again a mere three days after the fact. The plaque had since been stolen numerous times, forcing the municipality of Leganés to begin selling replicas of the official street plaque.[182] On 1 October 2004, a central Melbourne thoroughfare, Corporation Lane, was renamed ACDC Lane in honour of the band. The City of Melbourne forbade the use of the slash character in street names, so the four letters were combined.[183] The lane is near Swanston Street where, on the back of a truck, the band recorded their video for the 1975 hit "It's a Long Way to the Top".[184]
                    AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 10 March 2003.[185] During the ceremony the band performed "Highway to Hell" and "You Shook Me All Night Long", with guest vocals provided by host Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. He described the band's power chords as "the thunder from down under that gives you the second most powerful surge that can flow through your body."[186] During the acceptance speech, Brian Johnson quoted their 1977 song "Let There Be Rock".[187] In May 2003, the Young brothers accepted a Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Service to Australian Music at the 2003 Music Winners Awards, during which Malcolm paid special tribute to Bon Scott, who was also a recipient of the award.[188]
