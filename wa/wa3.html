        <h1>AC/DC</h1>
        <h2></h2>
            <p>AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973. It was founded by rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Malcolm Young and lead guitarist Angus Young. The band's current lineup comprises with founding member and songwriter Angus, rhythm guitarist Stevie Young, bassist Cliff Williams, drummer Phil Rudd, and long-time lead vocalist Brian Johnson. Their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, but the band calls it simply "rock and roll". They are cited as a former influence on the new wave of British heavy metal bands, such as Iron Maiden and Saxon. AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.
                AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their debut album, High Voltage (1975). Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers with Bon Scott (lead vocals), Mark Evans (bass) and Phil Rudd (drums). Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has since appeared on every album since Powerage (1978). Seven months after the release of the band's breakthrough album Highway to Hell (1979), Scott died of alcohol poisoning and the other members considered disbanding. However, at the request of Scott's parents, they continued together and recruited English singer Brian Johnson as their new frontman. Their first album with Johnson, Back in Black (1980), was dedicated to Scott's memory. It was a widespread success, launching the band to new heights and becoming the second-best-selling album of all time.  
                The band's eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock (1981), was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Prior to the release of their next album, Flick of the Switch (1983), Rudd left the band and was replaced by Simon Wright, who was himself replaced by Chris Slade six years later. The band experienced a commercial resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of their twelfth studio album The Razors Edge (1990); it was their only album to feature Slade, who was replaced by the returning Rudd in 1994. Rudd has since recorded five more albums with the band, starting with Ballbreaker (1995). Their fifteenth studio album Black Ice was the second-highest-selling album of 2008 and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching number 1 worldwide.
                The band's lineup remained the same for 20 years until 2014, when Malcolm Young retired due to early-onset dementia (from which he died three years later) and Rudd became involved in legal troubles. Malcolm was replaced by his nephew Stevie Young, who debuted on the album Rock or Bust (2014). On the accompanying tour, previous drummer Chris Slade filled in for Rudd. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to worsening hearing loss, and Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose stepped in as the band's frontman for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-time bassist and backing vocalist Williams retired at the end of the Rock or Bust World Tour in 2016, and the group entered a four-year hiatus. A reunion of the Rock or Bust line-up was announced in September 2020, and the band's seventeenth studio album Power Up was released two months later. In September 2023, it was revealed that American drummer Matt Laug will be filling in for the upcoming Power Trip festival.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
                <h3>Formation and name (1973–1974)</h3>
                    <p>In November 1973, Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC with bassist and saxophonist Larry Van Kriedt, vocalist Dave Evans, and drummer Colin Burgess.[1] The band's first official gig was at Chequers nightclub in Sydney on 31 December 1973.[2] By this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang.[3] In its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit. On stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet. In Paul Stenning's book AC/DC: Two Sides To Every Glory it was stated that Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's bitter feeling toward Evans.
                        Malcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials "AC/DC" on the AC adapter of a sewing machine. "AC/DC" is an abbreviation meaning "alternating current/direct current" electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, power-driven performances of their music.[5] "AC/DC" is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as "Acca Dacca" in Australia.[6] The AC/DC band name is stylised with a high voltage sign separating the "AC" and "DC" and has been used on all studio albums, with the exception of the international version of Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.[7] 
                        In January 1974, the band recorded a session at EMI Studios in Sydney, with producers George Young and Harry Vanda. A number of songs were recorded, including "Can I Sit Next To You, Girl" and "Rockin' In The Parlour", and an early version of "Rock 'n' Roll Singer".[8] A week after this session Burgess was fired, followed shortly thereafter by Van Kriedt, his recorded bass lines for the January recording session replaced by ones played by George Young. Their replacements, Neil Smith on bass and Noel Taylor on drums, lasted six weeks, replaced in turn by Rob Bailey on bass and Peter Clack on drums. "Can I Sit Next To You, Girl" backed with "Rockin' In The Parlour", taken from the January session, would be released on 22 July 1974 as the band's first single.[8][9]
                        By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation, which led to a support slot for the visiting Lou Reed in August. During that tour, Malcolm switched to rhythm guitar, leaving Angus the lead, the roles the two guitarists would play from then on.[10] Sometime in 1974, on the recommendation of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club, the Hard Rock. He was not pleased with their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and Harry Vanda.[11] The Young brothers decided to abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end, they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group.[4] Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.</p>
                <h3>Bon Scott joins, and beginnings (1974–1976)</h3>
                    <p>In September 1974, Bon Scott, an experienced vocalist from Fraternity after friend Vince Lovegrove recommended him to George Young. Scott's appointment coincided with him working as a chauffeur for the band at the time until an audition promoted him to lead singer.[12] Like the Young brothers, Scott was born in Scotland and emigrated to Australia in his childhood. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, "Can I Sit Next to You, Girl" / "Rockin' in the Parlour"; the song was re-written and re-recorded with Bon Scott.
                        By October 1974, AC/DC had recorded their first studio album, High Voltage. While Bailey and Clack were still in the band during its recording, Bailey played only on one track, the rest being played by session drummer Tony Currenti, while George Young handled some of the bass parts and later redid others. Recording the album took only ten days and was based on instrumentals written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott.[13] The period December 1974 to March 1975 saw rapid turnover within the band: both Bailey and Clack were fired, with Paul Matters taking over bass duties briefly before being fired in turn and replaced temporarily by George or Malcolm Young for live duties, while on drums, Ron Carpenter and Russell Coleman also had brief tenures before Phil Rudd joined the band in January. Bassist Mark Evans joined in March 1975, setting the lineup that would survive for the next two years.[14]
                        The band were scheduled to play at the 1975 Sunbury Pop music festival in January; however, they went home without performing following an altercation with the management and crew of headlining act Deep Purple.[15] High Voltage was released exclusively in Australia on 17 February 1975,[16] along with a single "Baby, Please Don't Go" / "Love Song". Later that year they released the single "It's a Long Way to the Top", for which a well-known promotional video was made for the program Countdown, featuring the band miming the song on the back of a flatbed truck. AC/DC released their second studio album, T.N.T., on 1 December 1975, which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand.[17]

                <h3>Initial success, and record deal (1976–1977)</h3>
                    <p>Browning sent promo material to contacts in London, which came to the attention of Phil Carson of Atlantic Records. In 1976, the band signed an international deal with Atlantic Records. On arrival in London, their scheduled tour with Back Street Crawler was cancelled following the death of Paul Kossoff. As a result, they went back to playing smaller venues to build a local following until their label organised the "Lock Up Your Daughters" tour sponsored by Sounds magazine, the only major music magazine which was still relatively receptive to traditional rock music. At the time, punk rock was breaking and came to dominate the pages of the major British music weeklies, NME and Melody Maker. AC/DC were sometimes identified with the punk rock movement by the British press, but the band hated punk rock, believing it to be a passing fad—manager Michael Browning wrote that "it wasn't possible to even hold a conversation with AC/DC about punk without them getting totally pissed off".[11] Their reputation managed to survive the punk upheavals and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time.[18] Angus Young gained notoriety for mooning the audience during live performances.
                        The first AC/DC album to gain worldwide distribution was a 1976 compilation of tracks taken from the High Voltage and T.N.T. LPs. Also titled High Voltage, and released on the Atlantic Records label, the album has to date sold three million copies worldwide.[19][20] The track selection was heavily weighted toward the more recent T.N.T., including only two songs from their first LP. The band's third studio album, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, was released in the same year in both Australian and international versions, like its predecessor. Track listings varied worldwide, and the international version of the album also featured the T.N.T. track "Rocker", which had previously not been released internationally. The original Australian version included "Jailbreak" (now more readily available on the 1984 compilation EP '74 Jailbreak or as a live version on the 1992 Live album). Dirty Deeds was not released in the US until 1981, by which time the band were at the peak of their popularity.
                        After a brief tour of Sweden, they returned to London where they set new attendance records during their residency at the Marquee. However, their appearance at the 1976 Reading Festival failed to get a response from the crowd. They toured extensively throughout Europe, then returned to tour Australia in late 1976 to rebuild their finances and record their fourth studio album, Let There Be Rock.
                        In early 1977, they returned to Britain and began a European tour with Black Sabbath. While Bon Scott and Ozzy Osbourne quickly became friends, relations were less than cordial between the other members of the respective bands. In one incident, Geezer Butler pulled a "knife" on Malcolm Young, though it was a "silly" flick-knife comb.[21][22] Later in the year they toured with Rainbow.</p>
                <h3>Cliff Williams joins, and death of Bon Scott (1977–1980)</h3>
                    <p>In mid-1977, bassist Mark Evans was dismissed. Evans described disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor. He was replaced by Cliff Williams, an experienced bass player who had played with several UK bands since the late 60s.[12] Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, "You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much of a nice guy."[3] Mark Evans' autobiography, Dirty Deeds: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.
